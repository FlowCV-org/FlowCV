/// Workspace for adding and routing components

/**
Components can be added to a Circuit via the AddComponent() method, and routed to and from other
components via the ConnectOutToIn() methods.

<b>NOTE:</b> Each component input can only accept a single "wire" at a time. When a wire is
connected to an input that already has a connected wire, that wire is replaced with the new one.
One output, on the other hand, can be distributed to multiple inputs.

To boost performance in stream processing circuits, multi-buffering can be enabled via the
SetBufferCount() method. A circuit's buffer count can be adjusted at runtime.

The Circuit Tick() method runs through it's internal array of components and calls each component's
Tick() and Reset() methods once. A circuit's Tick() method can be called in a loop from the main
application thread, or alternatively, by calling StartAutoTick(), a separate thread will spawn,
automatically calling Tick() continuously until PauseAutoTick() or StopAutoTick() is called.

TickMode::Parallel (default) will spawn a thread per component in a circuit. The aim of this mode
is to improve the performance of circuits that contain parallel branches. TickMode::Series on the
other hand, tells the circuit to tick its components one-by-one in a single thread. This mode aims
to improve the performance of circuits that do not contain parallel branches.
