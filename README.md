### About

---

FlowCV is a free open source dataflow framework for computer vision processing workflows.

**Key Features:**
* Free and Open Source
* Intuitive User Interface
* OpenCV Integration
* Highly Performant C++ Code
* Plugin SDK to Easily Extend Functionality
* Cross Platform Compatability
* Headless executable for production ready deployment

The advantage of the dataflow framework is that it allows you to quickly create complex directed graph
processing flows that can branch and run in parallel to maximize processing resources and throughput.

To make the creation of these workflows easy and intuitive there is a node graph editor user interface.
The editor allows you to easily create new nodes, connect the various inputs and outputs, adjust settings and send the resulting data over the network, for example to an embedded control system for automation, robotics or for data collection.

Once you're done creating your flow graph you can deploy it for production on your platform of choice
using the headless processing application.
